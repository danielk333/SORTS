SORTS
=====
SORTS is a multipurpose simulation toolbox which can be used to simulate radar measurements of space objects. However, the library has been designed to be used for a much broader scope of applications, including radar scheduler/controller design, simulation of measurement and physical errors, reading of space object database, and many more.

This documentation aims at describing the installation, use and implemented features of SORTS. Its purpose is also to describe its fundamental architecture to help developpers implement new features to the toolbox.
