# Creating an environment for SORTS using conda and pip

Dependencies are listed in the file 'sorts.yml'.  Creating a conda environment
involves the following steps:

1) Clone the git repositories for SORTS, pyorb and pyant.
    In the below, we will use the paths ~/src/git/{SORTS,pyorb,pyant}.
    Substitute your own locations as needed.

2) Install conda, using e.g. 'miniconda' or 'anaconda':

    https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html

3) Create and activate the conda environment for SORTS.

    cd ~/src/git/SORTS/conda
    conda env create -f sorts.yml
    conda activate sorts

4) Install the 'pyorb' and 'pyant' dependencies, as well as SORTS itself:

    cd ~/src/git/pyorb
    pip install -e .
    cd ~/src/git/pyant
    pip install -e .
    cd ~/src/git/SORTS
    pip install -e .

5) Verify that you can 'import sorts' in python:

    python -c 'import sorts'
